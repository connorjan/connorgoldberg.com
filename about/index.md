I currently am a third year student at <a href="http://rit.edu" target="_blank">RIT</a>, and
am in the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/program/bsms-electrical-engineering" target="_blank">BS/MS program</a> in Electrical Engineering.
I am also in the 'Computer Option' which means I take more of the computer-oriented classes.

I am currently on co-op at <a href="http://www.railcomm.com" target="_blank">RailComm</a> for the Spring semester! I am on the Embedded Systems 
team, working on some really great and fun projects.

I am currently looking for a Co-op for the Spring/Summer of 2016. I am very interested in 
Hardware Engineering, <a href="http://connorgoldberg.com/projects/risc_cpu" target="_blank">Digital Logic Design</a>, 
Embedded Systems, and Software, however, my main goal is to learn and get some great experiences!

###Interests
I love sports (namely <a href="http://www.rit.edu/sg/rball" target="_blank">Racquetball</a>, Hockey, and Swimming), 
I enjoy <a href="http://www.geocaching.com" target="_blank">Geocaching</a>, Rubik's Cubes and other puzzles, 
all things Apple, backing projects on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>, and many other fun things! 
I also enjoy programming and am very familiar with Verilog, VHDL, C/C++, assembly, and Python.
