PROJECTS/LABS-
Digital Systems II Lab
Both VHDL and Verilog HDL languages were used to design and construct a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPU, including the Data Path and the Control Unit.  The CPU was constructed using a combination of behavioral and structural design methodology.

Intro to Digital Systems Lab
Digital Circuits were designed then constructed on a prototyping board with IC chips; circuits were analyzed using Altera Quartus and ModelSim.

AssemblerAn assembler for a custom architecture designed in Digital Systems II was made using C++.* *Expected completion May 2014.
