Hello! I'm Connor Goldberg.

I am currently a second year student at [RIT](http://rit.edu "Rochester Institute of Technology"), and
am in the [BS/MS program](http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/program/bsms-electrical-engineering) in Electrical Engineering.

I am currently looking for a Co-op for 2014 during the Summer, or Summer and Fall. Ever since taking the class
Digital Systems II last semester, I have been very interested in Digital Logic Design! More information about that
[here!](http://connorgoldberg.com/projects/risc_cpu)

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
