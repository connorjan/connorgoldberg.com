title: Embedded Systems Design
---

In the Fall Semester of 2014 I had a course involving Embedded Systems Design. The course lecture
covered many topics ranging from the overall structure of an embedded system, protocols of serial
communication, ADCs, DACs, and much more. 

The course also had a lab that complemented the lecture topics. The lab consisted of working with a
<a href="http://www.ti.com/ww/en/launchpad/launchpads-msp430-msp-exp430g2.html" target="_blank">TI Launchpad</a>.
The labs all involved working with this microcontroller, writing C and assembly code to implement various
programs. The final lab was a combination of many of the previous labs, and the final report of the lab
can be found below. Also check out my blog post on the topic [here](blog/2014/12/08/embedded-systems/)!
