Hello! I'm Connor Goldberg.

I am currently a second year student at [RIT](http://rit.edu "Rochester Institute of Technology"), and
am in the [BS/MS program](http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/program/bsms-electrical-engineering) in Electrical Engineering.
I am also in the 'Computer Option' which means I get to take more computer-oriented classes such as C++. 

I am currently looking for a Co-op for 2014 during the Summer, or Summer and Fall. I am willing to do anything, but ever since taking the class
*Digital Systems II* last semester, I have been very interested in Digital Logic Design! More information about that
[here!](http://connorgoldberg.com/projects/risc_cpu)

###Interests
I love sports (namely Racquetball, Hockey, and Swimming), I enjoy [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com), Rubik's Cubes and other puzzles, 
all things Apple, [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com), and many other fun things! 
I also enjoy programming and am familiar with Python, and C++.

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:
