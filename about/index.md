<img style="float: right" src="/static/Head.png" height="250">

I am currently a third year student at [RIT](http://rit.edu "Rochester Institute of Technology"), and
am in the [BS/MS program](http://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/program/bsms-electrical-engineering) in Electrical Engineering.
I am also in the 'Computer Option' which means I get to take more computer-oriented classes such as C++. 

I am currently looking for a Co-op for 2015 during the Spring Semester and Summer. I am very interested in 
Hardware Engineering, [Digital Logic Design](http://connorgoldberg.com/projects/risc_cpu), and Embedded Systems, however, my main goal is to learn and get
some great experiences! 

###Interests
I love sports (namely Racquetball, Hockey, and Swimming), I enjoy [Geocaching](http://www.geocaching.com), Rubik's Cubes and other puzzles, 
all things Apple, [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com), and many other fun things! 
I also enjoy programming and am familiar with Python, and C++.
