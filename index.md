# Welcome!

I recently graduated from [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu){: target="_blank" style="color: #f36e21;"}
with my Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Electrical Engineering. I spent the
summer writing my graduate paper on a custom 32-bit RISC architecture and
corresponding compiler backend in [LLVM](http://llvm.org/){:target="_blank"}.
Read more about it [here]({{ site.url }}/projects/grad)!

I am now working on some really cool projects and getting a ton of experience at [Northrop Grumman](http://northropgrumman.com/){:target="_blank"}!
I currently am doing digial logic, SoC, and embedded systems design.

See more [about me here.]({{ site.url }}/about) Also check out
