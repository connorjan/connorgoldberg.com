# Welcome!

I am fifth year Electrical Engineering student currently 
attending <a href="http://rit.edu" target="_blank">Rochester Institute of Technology</a>. I am currently
working on my both my BS and MS degree planning to graduate with both this May! 

Last Semester I was on <a href="http://www.rit.edu/co-op.html" target="_blank">co-op</a> working at 
<a href="https://www.harris.com/" target="_blank">Harris</a>. And I can't believe I'm actually writing this,
but I am now looking for a full time position for after this school year!
