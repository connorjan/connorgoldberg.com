# Welcome!

I am fifth year Electrical Engineering student currently 
attending [Rochester Institute of Technology](http://rit.edu){: target="_blank" style="color: #f36e21;"}. I am currently
working on my both my BS and MS degree planning to graduate with both this May! 

Last Semester I was on [co-op](http://www.rit.edu/co-op.html){:target="_blank"} working at 
[Harris](https://www.harris.com/){:target="_blank" style="color: #E21D22;"}. And I can't believe I'm actually writing this,
but I am now looking for a full time position for after this school year!
