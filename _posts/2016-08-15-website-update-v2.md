For the past couple weeks I have spent a bit of time updating my website. The overall aesthetics are extremely
similar, however the framework on which it is built is much nicer, cleaner, and more conducive to what I want it
to be able to do.

My older website (v1) was built upon [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon){:target="_blank"}
by [Mark Otto](https://github.com/mdo){:target="_blank"} which was a great starting point for me at the time.
This version of my website (v2) is built upon [Lanyon-plus](https://github.com/dyndna/lanyon-plus){:target="_blank"}!
This framework is an extension to Lanyon adding features specific to [Jekyll 3](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"},
a better organization for the files, and some other cool features like [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/){:target="_blank"}
(the header and footer icons) and of course... [emoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji){:target="_blank"} :wink:.

The biggest reason I spent time to update my website to this new framework was to create a larger incentive for myself
to improve and update it. Even though I spent a lot of time reading through the html and css files that help build the static
pages for this website, it only helped me get a better grasp of the site. As for the previous site, I did not really
understand what was happening behind the scenes to build the static pages, but now I feel very comfortable editing
the html and css to try and make my website exactly the way I want it. For example I have added some simple javascript
and css to create a progress bar that changes its width depending on how far a blog post has been scrolled down.

There of course will be bugs here and there as I am not an expert web designer, however, it is a fun project to keep
maintained and I am much more motivated now to keep tweaking it and adding content. If you want to see the code then
go take a look at the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/connorjan/connorjan.github.io){:target="_blank"} where it lives!
