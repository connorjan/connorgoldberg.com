# **R**educed **I**nstruction **S**et **C**omputer

In the Fall semester of 2013 I was inrolled in a class, Digital Systems II. This expaned upon
the class, Intro to Digital Systems. Intro to Digital Systems covered the basics of logic
gates, boolean algebra, basic logic functions, and Finate State Machine design methodology.

Digital Systems II was much more involved. Insead of using IC's and prototyping boards as 
in Intro to Digital Systems, an [Altera FPGA](http://www.altera.com/education/univ/materials/boards/de0-nano/unv-de0-nano-board.html) 
was used along with Verilog and VHDL. A project was completed each week of the semester.
The early weeks started out as an introduction to the software and languages. After a few
weeks, we started creating larger projects such as an ALU, and simple I/O Register map. 
The larger projects started to come together to eventually form a fully functional
Reduced Instruction Set Computer.
