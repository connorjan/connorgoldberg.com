It turns out I have not actually updated the projects on my website in quite some time. I have decided to fix that and
have now documented the major projects I have accomplished throughout the past year over on [my projects page](/projects/).

I've done a lot over the past year! Last school year was by far the busiest and probably the most project-intense year I will have
during my RIT career. Last Fall I took two classes which taught me so much about computer architecture, programming, and
digital design:

- [Cell Layouts](/projects/cell_layouts/)
- [RISC 521 Processor](/projects/risc_521/)

Then just when I thought I couldn't possibly learn more in a single semester, spring came around and proved that thought
severely wrong. In the spring I also accomplished two large digital-focused classes containing important projects:

- [A Multi-Channel ADPCM CODEC with IEEE Paper](/projects/mcac/)
- [RISC 721 Processor](/projects/risc_721/)

Then to finish it all up I went away to Maryland for the summer where I was on co-op with Harris:

- [Co-op at Harris](/blog/2016/08/20/harris-co-op/)

This semester I am back at school and the projects are picking up again. I am enrolled in a class called
*High‚ÄêSpeed Digital & Mixed Signal PCB Design*. The course will go through creating an entire PCB design
from scratch. For my project I chose to design a Bluetooth & Wi-Fi Audio receiver and amplifier board. It
is still very much a work in progress but expect to see updates along the way!

Lastly, I am enrolled in
RIT's [Multidisciplinary Senior Design](https://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/facility/multidisciplinary-senior-design-space){:target="_blank" style="color: {{ site.data.colors.RIT }}"}
class. I am on a team to design and create a High Altitude Balloon (HAB) system. The HAB's main goal is to carry
[CubeSats](http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/cubesats/index.html){:target="_blank"} with the HAB so the CubeSat can perform
its tests in a space-like environment prior to its official launch. I am very excited about this project and
it will be very fun to be working on this for the next two semesters. You can also view our team's project page about
the project [here](http://edge.rit.edu/edge/P17104/public/Home){:target="_blank"}!
