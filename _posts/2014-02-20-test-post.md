###Markdown testing!

This is me getting a feel for how things are layed out and how things work with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Thanks John Gruber!

Python code!

```python
def thing():
	with number as hello:
		number = 2 * hello
```

C++ code! :P

```c++
int DoNotDoThis(youDoThis)
{
	int failed = 1;
	int badStuffWillHappen = 0;
	if (youDoThis)
		goto fail;
		goto fail;
	return failed;
	
	fail:
		return badStuffWillHappen;
}
```
